        Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
        distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
        here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
        text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
        in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
        like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief,

        Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
